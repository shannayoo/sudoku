'''
Note: there could be more than one solution for the same board in these tests

Expectations:
Default BT:
The first two cases are expected to be solved in a few seconds
The last two cases are expected to be solved in a few minutes

With FC:
All cases are expected to be solved in a few seconds

With GAC:
All cases are expected to be solved in a few seconds but faster than FC
